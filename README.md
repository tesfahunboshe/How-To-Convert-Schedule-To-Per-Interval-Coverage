# How-To-Convert-Schedule-To-Per-Interval-Coverage
Let’s say you have just created a schedule for your workforce. If your workforce has the same shift start and shift end in all days, it should be easy to find how many heads you will have per interval. What if that was not the case? Most WFM schedulers have to create much more dynamic schedules with not only multiple shift start and shift end but also with shifts going across days. It is also possible that agents do not work all the days, and the shifts are of varying length. Once you have created such schedule, how do you convert it to coverage data to check your efficiency per interval? I have seen some excel solutions for this but let’s see how we can do this in much easier way using R. At the end of this, we will plot the coverage against the predetermined requirement and calculate the schedule efficiency.
